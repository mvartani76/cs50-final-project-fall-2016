# Simple IoT with CakePHP
Source Code and Documentation for Final project for CS50 class

This repository has three sub-directories: Arduino, cs50-final-iOS, and cs50-php-app.

**Arduino** - This subdirectory contains a couple samples of code written for the Arduino UNO. The code reads values from external sensors and sends them to the simple IoT Platform and stores in an MySQL database via a RESTful API. There are separate Arduino sketches for ethernet and wifi connectivity.

**cs50-final-iOS** - This subdirectory contains the source code for an iOS application that emulates an embedded device that is reading sensors. The application sends the data to the simple IoT Platform and stores in an MySQL database via a RESTful API as well.

**cs50-php-app** - This subdirectory contains the code for the IoT platform using the CakePHP v3.3 frameworks (Red Velvet).


## YouTube Project Description
I created a two minute video that very briefly describes the project, the motivations for doing the project, the requirements, and location for the project and source code. This video can be accessed at the link below:
